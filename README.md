## Features

Ogres aims to be a very lightweight alternative to some of the more comprehensive tools available today. Its limited core feature-set is intended to help dungeon masters quickly setup encounters and adventures with only the most important necessities.

- Instantly start preparing your game; no sign-ups or ads
- Start an online collaborative session for your friends
- Prepare and manage multiple scenes at once
- Built-in initiative tracker for streamlined encounters
- Responsive design for phones and tablets
- Easy to use for other game systems
- ... and much more planned!
